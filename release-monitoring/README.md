# Release Monitoring

This package provides a preconfigured Dynatrace dashboard for monitoring and analyzing software releases across your environments. The dashboards deliver both high-level overviews and detailed insights into release activities, validation results, and associated risks such as detected vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Release Overview:** Visualize all releases across environments at a glance.
- **Detailed Filtering:** Drill down to specific releases or environments for more granular analysis.
- **Risk & Validation Tracking:** Quickly identify validation outcomes and potential risks (e.g., vulnerabilities) associated with each release.
- **Ready-to-Use Dashboards:** Get started quickly with pre-built dashboards and example configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Review and implement Dynatrace [version detection strategies](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/deliver/release-monitoring/version-detection-strategies).
- Ensure all required prerequisites listed in the Dynatrace documentation are met.
