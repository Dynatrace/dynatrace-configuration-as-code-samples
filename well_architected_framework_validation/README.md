monaco deploy manifest.yaml
```

## üìã Configuration Overview

### Guardian Configuration
The sample includes comprehensive Site Reliability Guardian configurations for each WAF pillar:

- **Reliability Guardian**: Monitors infrastructure resilience and fault tolerance
- **Security Guardian**: Validates security posture and compliance
- **Performance Guardian**: Tracks performance optimization metrics
- **Cost Guardian**: Monitors resource utilization and cost efficiency
- **Operational Excellence Guardian**: Validates operational processes
- **Sustainability Guardian**: Tracks environmental impact metrics

### Workflow Integration
Automated workflows that:

1. **Monitor cloud infrastructure** across all six pillars
2. **Evaluate compliance** against WAF best practices
3. **Generate compliance reports** for governance teams
4. **Send alerts** for non-compliant resources
5. **Track improvement trends** over time

## üîß Customization Options

### Compliance Thresholds
Adjust the Guardian rules to match your compliance requirements:

```yaml
# Example compliance thresholds
reliability:
  availability: 99.9%
  fault_tolerance: 99.5%
  disaster_recovery: enabled

security:
  encryption: enabled
  access_control: enforced
  compliance_standards: met

cost_optimization:
  resource_utilization: 70%
  cost_efficiency: optimized
  budget_compliance: within_limits
```

### Integration Customization
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Enhanced metrics and logging integration
- **Compliance tools**: Integration with existing compliance platforms
- **Reporting systems**: Custom compliance reporting and dashboards
