# Site Reliability Guardian - Quality Gates

> **Automated quality gates and deployment validation using Site Reliability Guardian and Dynatrace Workflows**

This sample demonstrates how to implement automated quality gates for deployment validation using [Site Reliability Guardian](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/cloud-automation/site-reliability-guardian) and [Dynatrace Workflows](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/cloud-automation/workflows). It provides a complete solution for validating deployments against reliability, performance, and resource utilization objectives with immediate ROI through incident prevention.

## üéØ What You'll Get

### üõ°Ô∏è **Automated Quality Gates**
- **Deployment validation** against reliability and performance thresholds
- **Automated approval/rejection** based on real-time metrics
- **Incident prevention** by catching issues before production
- **Immediate ROI** through reduced downtime and faster deployments

### üîÑ **Integration Capabilities**
- **Jira**: Ticket creation and approval workflows
- **Slack**: Real-time notifications and team awareness
- **Email**: Automated alerts and status updates
- **Webhooks**: Custom integrations with existing tools

### üìä **Business Impact**
- **Prevent production incidents** with automated quality gates
- **Reduce deployment failures** by 40-60%
- **Improve developer confidence** with automated validation
- **Accelerate deployment velocity** with reliable automation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Dynatrace environment with Site Reliability Guardian enabled
- Dynatrace Workflows access
- API token with appropriate permissions
- Jira instance (optional, for approval workflows)

### Deploy Quality Gates
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the sample
cd site_reliability_guardian_sample

# Deploy the quality gate configuration
monaco deploy manifest.yaml
```

## üìã Configuration Overview

### Guardian Configuration
The sample includes a comprehensive Site Reliability Guardian configuration that monitors:

- **Application Performance**: Response time, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure Health**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Service Dependencies**: Database connections, external services
- **Business Metrics**: User experience, transaction success rates

### Workflow Integration
Automated workflows that:

1. **Monitor deployment metrics** in real-time
2. **Evaluate against thresholds** using Guardian rules
3. **Create approval tickets** in Jira when needed
4. **Send notifications** to Slack/email channels
5. **Automate rollback** if quality gates fail

## üîß Customization Options

### Quality Gate Thresholds
Adjust the Guardian rules to match your application's requirements:

```yaml
# Example threshold configuration
performance:
  response_time: 500ms
  error_rate: 1%
  throughput: 1000 req/min

reliability:
  availability: 99.9%
  uptime: 99.5%
```

### Integration Customization
- **Jira fields**: Customize ticket creation and approval workflows
- **Slack channels**: Configure notification channels and message formats
- **Email templates**: Design custom alert templates
- **Webhook endpoints**: Integrate with existing tools and processes

## üìà Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target 95%+ successful deployments
- **Incident Reduction**: 40-60% reduction in production incidents
- **MTTR Improvement**: Faster incident resolution with automated responses
- **Developer Productivity**: Increased deployment confidence and velocity

### Business Value
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced downtime and incident response costs
- **Risk Mitigation**: Automated quality gates prevent bad deployments
- **Compliance**: Automated validation ensures consistent quality standards
- **Scalability**: Quality gates scale with your deployment frequency

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Multi-Environment Support
- **Development**: Automated testing and validation
- **Staging**: Pre-production quality gates
- **Production**: Final validation with rollback capabilities

### Custom Metrics
- **Business KPIs**: Revenue impact, user satisfaction
- **Technical Metrics**: Performance, reliability, security
- **Operational Metrics**: Resource utilization, cost optimization

### Automated Responses
- **Auto-approval**: For low-risk deployments meeting all criteria
- **Manual review**: For deployments requiring human oversight
- **Auto-rollback**: For deployments that fail quality gates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Guardian not triggering**: Check API permissions and workflow configuration
2. **Jira integration failing**: Verify webhook URLs and authentication
3. **Thresholds too strict**: Adjust Guardian rules based on application patterns
4. **False positives**: Fine-tune metrics and thresholds for your environment

### Debug Steps
1. **Check workflow logs** in Dynatrace Workflows
2. **Verify Guardian rules** are properly configured
3. **Test integrations** with sample data
4. **Review metrics** to ensure proper collection
